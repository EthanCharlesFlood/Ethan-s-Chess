# ETHANS CHESS!

A simple console implementation of chess built with ruby.

Utilizes OOP principles to build the fundamentals of the game of chess in a way that
it can be played between two human players in the terminal.

Game structure is divided into several classes and modules. There are classes for the board,
the display, the cursor which uses keymapping to allow WASD movement and piece selection,
the pieces which utilize modules and a superclass, the player, the game itself, and the colorize gem.
